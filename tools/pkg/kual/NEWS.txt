  (i.e., the Oasis and the Basic 2).
  Massive thanks to chrox and his KPVBooklet (https://github.com/koreader/kpvbooklet)
  for support and inspiration,
  as well as bhaak's HackedUpReaderBooklet (https://github.com/bhaak/HackedUpReaderBooklet/).
- Updated the documentation accordingly. Do read it.

**** v2.6 ****

20150814
- Implemented the PW3 detection properly.

20150730
+ Potentially detect the Kindle PaperWhite 3. Most likely innacurate.

**** v2.5 ****

20141123
- Call on a faithful Wizard if need be!

20141108
- Rewrote the MR thread. Should now be more concise.

20141107
+ Detect the Kindle Voyage, because why the hell not? ;p

20141005
+ Detect the Kindle Basic, because I'm the hopeful kind of guy... ;D

**** v2.4 ****

+ Added support for the missing 4GB PW2 variants.

20140621
+ Make the font used by KUAL user-configurable
+ Switches to Futura Regular as the default UI font on KDK-2

20140306
+ Added support for the missing PW2 variant(s).

**** v2.3 ****

20140219
+ Minor code refactoring/cleanup
+ More buildsystem tweaks to fix some portability issues introduced in the
  previous changes
+ Tweaked the default 'sort' buttons in the KUAL menu to be consistent with
  the KUAL+ extension.

20131005
+ Detect the PaperWhite 2/2013 as KindlePaperWhite2 (PW2).

20130929
+ Multiple tweaks to the build system:
  . Automatically strip the commented parser (dropped the stripped version
  from the repo)
  . Use a git-describe tag instead of a manual date as the version tag
  . Bundle a ChangeLog built with git log (renamed this manual ChangeLog,
  where we can be a bit more verbose than a commit log (or more
  concise/user-friendly).
  . Pushed git tags for all known releases
  . Also add the date of the last commit to the version tag
+ Wrote a minimal dist script for packaging
- Tweak the format of the default status bar:
    . Use a square bullet to separate our three fields.
    . Use the nickname of the device instead of its full model name.

20130928,a
- Make the menu refresh triggered by refresh:true faster by running only one
  parser instance instead of two, potentially concurrently.

20130927,a
- Minor fixes to the parser to make it at least run on mawk, and throw a
  couple of warnings less with gawk's lint check.
- Check for mailbox notifications on keypresses, too.

20130926,a
+ Use the custom gawk binary from the gawk extension if it's installed.
  it seems to be roughly 4 times faster on my Touch :).
  The extension is available here:
  http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2636883&postcount=59

20130920,a
- Try to cleanup behind us on exit. Here be dragons!
  Please test and check that, especially, this:
    1. doesn't utterly break KUAL
    2. actually does what it's supposed to
    3. doesn't break suicidal buttons (exitmenu: true)

**** v2.2 ****

20130816,a
- Try to create the extensions folder & a blank config file if we can't find a
  proper config file at init.

20130809,a
- Fix -o RPN operator, which got broken in 20130701,a
# Git: changes to make easier dealing with the parser script: **FOR DEVELOPERS**
  . ignore bitbucket's 'commented' branch from this commit on, and
  . find the important files in ./resources:
    . parse-commented.awk (used to be aloop/aloop-v2.awk in commented branch)
    . CHANGELOG.txt (this file, used to be aloop/CHANGELOG.txt in the
      commented branch)
  . add resources/README-tool.txt, which explains the main point:
    1. edit ./resources/parse-commented.awk to change the parser code, then
    2. in ./resources run
       ./tool/strip.awk -v AWK=1 parse-commented.awk > parse.awk
    3. compile the project

**** v2.1 ****

20130719,a
+ Fix [#6] & [#5]:
  Implemented a set of keyboard shortcuts on devices without a touchscreen:
    * the next/prev page buttons do the obvious
    * the top row of keys (1...0 and Q...P) select the corresponding button
      (or the last if there are more keys than buttons)
    * enter & space will click the current focus
    * the [Aa] & [Keyboard] keys focus the top button
    * while the [MENU] key focuses the last button (it's tailored for the K4
      layout, those buttons bracket the five-way controller).
- Fix [#3]: we always count the extra quit or / button we add as the last item
  of a menu level, and we don't forget to add even it if it falls at the top of
  a new page.
- Fix [#11]: rewrite get_model to properly differentiate the Kindle 2 from the
  DX (AFAICT, their cpuinfo output is perfectly identical). We get a
  finer-grained KindleDX model detection in the bargain ;).
# Don't bundle useless (at runtime) resources in the final jar.
- Fix [#12]: We now properly draw the shiny unicode glyphs (arrows, checkmarks,
  ...) on the K2/DX.
# Refactored duplicated code between KualLabel and KualButton.
- Fix [#1]: The checkmarks are now drawn properly on non-touch devices
  (and really is a checkmark, not a cross).
- Fix [#8]: Don't overwrite a custom status text if the button requested a
  refresh
- Fix [#10]: Apply an if clause to a submenu itself, too
# Tweaked afterParser default value a bit (+50%) on armv6 devices (K2/DX/3).

**** v2.0 ****

20130701,a
- Fix: add missing -m RPN operator (reported by NiLuJe)

20130523,a
+ Improved status messages when the menu gets reloaded.

20130519,a
# Changed support link to bit.ly/kualit.

20130314,a
+ Now "if":"expression" can grep a file, test loaded extensions, test device
  model, compare KUAL option values, test file existence and size.
# Now KUAL self menu hides "save log" button when the log file is empty.

20130513,a
+ Added: menu collation feature merges same-name sub-menus together.
  Same-name plain items, if any, are left unchanged.
  Can even merge user menus named "KUAL" with the KUAL self menu.
+ New KUAL.cfg setting: KUAL_collate=false disables collation (default enabled).

20130312,a
Internal changes:
+ Added KualLog().printStackTrace().

20130511,a
+ Added JSON key/value "if":"conditional expression" to conditionally
  display a menu item.

20130509,a
- Fixed bitbucket issue #4.
# Added JSON key/value "internal":"internal command" to replace
  and expand the now unsupported special commands "TRAIL" and "STATUS".
  See mobileread Wiki page for details.
+ Tool updates.

20130502,a
+ Added: JSON "status":false disables displaying the contents of JSON
  "action":"commands" in the status line prior to launching action.
# Added: JSON "date":true displays the current date/time in the
  status line after having launched an action.
. Removed: temporary button 'Clear cache on restart (temp)'

20130430,a
- Fixed: no button focused on 5-way controller devices!

20130429,a
# More robust, possibly faster, kindlet start.

20130428,a
- Fix: spurious message 'cannot update cached menu' in KUAL.log
+ Added: JSON key/value "refresh":true rescans /mnt/us/extensions
  and refreshes the displayed menu. This enables extensions to
  'dynamically change' the menu.

Internal changes:
+ Class KualLog in package resources

20130427,a
+ Auto-reload changed menu.

Internal changes:
+ Classes KualMenu, kualConfig, and MailboxProcessor in package resources
+ Interface MailboxCommand in package resources
# Kindlet code refactoring

20130425,a
# Testing usability of left-sided up button and new toTop and Quit buttons
- Fixed: kindlet could run on either KT or K3 but not both (timer issue)
+ Added checked buttons - JSON key/value "checked":true
  . FIXME K3 doesn't repaint the button label immediately
+ Added toTop and Quit buttons - placed after all level buttons
. Minor cosmetic changes

Internal changes:
+ Class KualEntry in package resources
+ Class TimerAdapter in package timer package
+ Class KualButton in package ui/v2
# Kindlet code refactoring

20130421,a
- Fixed: failed starting on K3/K4
+ Added: auto-delete old cache file on new version upgrade.
- Fixed: spurious "can't hash" error message on very first start.

20130420,a
+ Added automatic cache expiration. Manual cache management should
  no longer be necessary. The 'Clear cache on restart' temporary
  button will be phased out shortly, unless testers report that it's
  still needed and why. Did you need to use it? Why?  Could you achieve
  the same result in a different way without pressing the button?
  . Tested on KT only

20130418,a
+ Added cache. KUAL starts faster when the cache exists.
  . Until implementation of a cache expiration policy (TODO) users
    Users need to manually delete the cache to apply changes
    to their configuration and menu. Use new button in KUAL menu
    'Clear cache on restart' - TEMPORARY.
  . The cache file includes all configuration data, so if you edit
    KUAL.cfg or change sort order you need to clear the cache.
# Change: In KUAL.cfg KUAL_options becomes KUAL_sort_mode.
   YOU NEED TO manually update your KUAL.cfg file once.
   # Change sorting options.
   # "ABC" (default) lexicographically sorts top-level entries only and
   # leaves sub-menu entries in the order that the menu author defined.
   # "ABC!" (bang) sorts ALL levels lexicographically.
   # "123" sorts EACH level by json key "priority" (=0 when unspecified)
   #KUAL_sort_mode="ABC"
+ Enhanced usability of sub-menu "KUAL"
! Certain features are discontinued to simplify async execution of
  the parser script (see Internal changes below).
  Discontinued features include:
  . Test applet - replaced by trail message button 'Add some extensions!'
  . 'Replace/Restore Store button' button - it may come back as a
     stand-alone extension for KT/PW, if enough interest.
  . The '[ "$KUAL" ] && $KUAL $n"' application interface. In particular
    this takes away the 4-line message display on which demo extension
    'Save KUAL from suicide' relies.
- Fix: added expansion of all JSON string escapes, \n \t etc.
  . KNOWN LIMITATION: can't expand \uHHHH escape
- Fixed rare (and harmless) error message upon sorting zero entries.

Planned (not in this build):
+ Menu collation. Stutus: implemented. Testing in progress.
+ Menu navigation improvements for lower devices.

Internal changes:
# Script parse.awk replaces parse.sh
+ Upgraded parser core to JSON.awk 1.10.
+ (EXPERIMENTAL) Async execution of the parser script. Now the kindlet
  does not wait for the parser to exit before calling initializeGUI().
  This change aims at buying the kindlet more time to build its GUI
  before the 5000 ms timeout expires. It also frees the parser to run
  errands as necessary after sending the kindlet the parsed menu - either
  from the cache file or from scratch.
# Minor tool and documentation updates.

20130412,a
# Change: ABC sorting only sorts the top-level entries and leaves sub-menu
    entries in the order that the menu author defined.
  . You can force ABC sorting at ALL levels by adding/changing the following
    option in KUAL.cfg:       KUAL_options="-s=ABC!"
  . If you use KUAL_options="-s=ABC" (without ! that is) or omit -s=xyz from
    KUAL_options you get top-level alphabetic sorting only (default).
  . Be aware that changing sort order from the "KUAL" sub-menu resets the
    value of -s=xyz in KUAL_options.
  . When ABC (not ABC!) sorting is in effect, you can rearrange the order of
    "KUAL" sub-menu entries by simply listing them in a specific order in
    option KUAL_show_KUAL_buttons, i.e.,  KUAL_show_KUAL_buttons="99 1 2 3"
    shows the Quit button on top. This tweak has no effect when 123 or ABC!
    sorting are in effect.
- Fixed tokenizer issue upon reading backslash-backslash in a JSON string
+ Improved JSON parser error reporting
# Changed error annunciator (cosmetic)

Internal changes:
# More dead wood removed from ash script.


20130410,a
- Fix regression in KUAL menu sort option
# Change: now ABC sorting ignores case
+ documentation updates

20130409,a
- Fix "wrong action is executed when a menu.json file includes multiple
  top-level items".
- Minor fixes and improvements

20130408,a
Fix kindlet timeout issue
- Fixed the reason for kindlet timeout issue in the parse script
+ Improved script's early error reporting mechanism

20130407,a
New options and default values speed up scanning /mnt/us/extensions
# Change: by default do not recurse /mnt/us/extensions/* when
  searching for json files. Equivalent to setting KUAL_search_depth=2
# Change: by default skip searching /mnt/us/extensions/system.
+ KUAL.cfg option: KUAL_search_depth="N"
  search /mnt/us/extensions up to N levels deep (default N=2)
+ KUAL.cfg option: KUAL_search_exclude_paths="system"
  semicolon-separated list of paths to exclude when scanning
  /mnt/us/extensions.
  It does make a noticeable difference when scanning a huge extension
  folder like the 'KUAL system' extension.  Comparison: KT running
  version 20130407a vs. 20130405a w/ and w/o 'system' extension
    20130407a w/o                w/
    real    0m 0.67s   real   0m 0.93s   <<<<
    user    0m 0.55s   user   0m 0.74s
    sys     0m 0.11s   sys    0m 0.11s

    20130405a w/o                w/

    sys     0m 0.14s   sys    0m 0.48s

20130405,a
Extensions can now write a message to the trail/status lines
+ Extension can write a fixed message into the trail line with json
  {"name":"label","action":"TRAIL","params":"this message","exitmenu":false}
+ Extension can write a verbatim message into the status line with json
  {"name":"label","action":"STATUS","params":"this message","exitmenu":false}
! Note that it's a fixed message; sh doesn't process it at all
+ Capture stderr of extensions to /var/tmp/KUAL.log
+ New KUAL sub-menu button "File KUAL log as a document"; moves KUAL.log to
  /mnt/us/documents/
! Still not quite working; the log file is always empty. Could it be due to the
  suicidal context ?!?
- Fix out of range index in setTrail()
- Removed more dead wood and command-line options -c -f,

20130404,d
- Fix file descriptors and segmentation fault
= Port of user option handling complete

20130404,c
- Fixed regression bug in EXTENSIONDIR scan
- Fixed missing version string (corner case)

20130404,b
+ ixtab's Unicode support for KualButton.
* commit to kindlelauncher repo

20130404,a
+ ixtab's KUAL 0.4.1 improved GUI buttons on lower devices.
Internal changes
+ Export interface #3: test_applet install
+ Scan EXTENSIONDIR and read KUAL.cfg in awk script
# Stripped more dead wood.

20130402,a
! Huge rewrite complete, I might have missed to reconnected all
  previous functions but, for the most part, KUAL 2 is here!
+ Dive-in menu support, 3 button navigation (prev, next, up) with
  trail line (press the trail line to go up).
+ Faster startup time. KT takes twobob's huge extensions folder no sweat.
+ Improved but -by design - UNFORGIVING json parser. Fix your menus.
  Invalid json files don't slow down loading the menu.
+ KUAL.log file in /mnt/us/extensions (pending bug fix).
+ KUAL menu stays fixed on top. Shows number of error messages, if any.
  Press any error message button => KUAL.log snapshot to /mnt/us/documents.
+ No suicide json key - "exitmenu":false
+ KUAL.cfg in /mnt/us/extensions, options to: selectively hide KUAL
  menu buttons, stop following links when looking for json files,
  hide the status line (sends status info to the trail line).
+ Show version/build number in the status line (if not hidden).
! Before starting any extension KUAL changes directory to the
  location of the menu.json file.
- Sundry bug fixes, improvements, cosmetics.
= KUAL menu: Quit, Store button, Sort 123, Sort ABC.
= Tested on KT 5.3.2 only. Should run on K3.

20130330,a
+ Start new version based on stepk's awk port of JSON.sh
! Urge to document - before I forget - the limits of nested menus:
  - maximum nesting level = 10 [0..9]
  - maximum entries per sub-menu = 255 [0..254]
    255^10 = 1,162,523,670,191,533,212,890,625 =~ =~ 1.1625 x 10^24
    1 septillion... 1 million billion billion...  Compare it with:
    4.3 x 10^17 seconds, age of the universe
    1.0 x 10^80 estimated number of atoms in the universe

20130329,b
! Archived version 20130329,b as the last version based on JSON.sh
  archive file ALOOP-JSON-SH-STABLE-20130329.zip
- Fixed null labels (again)
- Corrected documentation (LIMITS)
- Fixed npath encoder - missing first "items" byte for level 0 keys

20130329,a
! Before starting any extension the script performs a change
  directory to the location of the menu.json file
+ Show menu trail line at screen north
+ KUAL.cfg option to hide the status line at screen south
     KUAL_no_show_status="true" # requires restart
  Note: it also rerouteѕ status messages to the trail line

20130324,a
! This is the last version compatible with KUAL1 flat menus.
- Fixed 'invalid syntax' label mangling
# Pressing any 'error message' button saves the KUAL error log as a document.
! Performance improvements. Ref. 20130318,a
  Not on the kindle but just on my PC.  Building menu with KUAL 2 vs KUAL 1
  KUAL2 has improved significantly

  # time ash aloop-v2.sh -p=tbl -v=2 >vvv2 *** KUAL2
  real 0m 2.29s
  user 0m 0.29s
  sys  0m 0.50s

  # time ash aloop-v2.sh -p=tbl -v=1 >vvv1 *** KUAL 1
  real 0m 1.79s
  user 0m 0.42s
  sys  0m 0.50s

  This is of course with invalid extensions removed, since leaving them in
  would trigger a menu recovery process in KUAL2 which would greatly slow
  down building a valid menu.

20130323,a
! Sorting is kind of broken now, but I don't care to fix it because
  eventually KUAL 2 will feature a different sorting strategy.
+ Improved error handling of invalid json files. Please note: just one
  invalid menu.json file slows down loading *all other* json files, so
  fix invalid files!
- Bug fix: connector between version 2 parser and version 1 GUI no
  longer gets stuck trying to report invalid json syntax to the kindlet
  . lists invalid files as button labels "Syntax ..filename.json"
  . tested on KT with twobob's huge extensions-K5-FAIL/ folder
+ Added 'save KUAL error log as document' function for other scripts to call.
+ KUAL.cfg option to stop following links when looking for json files:
  KUAL defaults to following links.
     KUAL_nofollow="true"    # stop following links
# changed json "exitmenu":0 to "exitmenu":false
+ added json "hidden":true to hide a menu (to be implemented)

20130319,b
+ selectively show one/more/all KUAL menu buttons
  In KUAL.cfg set
    KUAL_show_KUAL_buttons="" (or don't set at all) to show all buttons
    KUAL_show_KUAL_buttons="1 2" to show buttons 1 and 2
    KUAL_show_KUAL_buttons="0" to hide all menu buttons
    As currently defined:
     1: replace/restore Store button with KUAL
     2: change KUAL sort order (double button)
    99: quit KUAL

20130318,a
- fixed bug introduced in ver 20130306,a which could cause
  weird things to happen. Twobob, this was for you, I think!

~~~ internal step towards KUAL2 ~~~
+ new json parsing engine can parse up to 9 sub-menu levels
  . the GUI hasn't changed yet so it can't show levels above 2
  . license MIT or APACHE 2
+ option -v=1|2 selects the parsing engine; 1=old 2=new(nested,DEFAULT)
  . the new engine exposes issue
    http://kual.knetconnect.com/forums/topic/menu-json-structure-and-future/#post-92
    KUAL team to fix invalid menu.json files out there?
  . unlike engine 1, engine 2 doesn't touch up labels anymore
  . unlike engine 1, engine 2 doesn't make up the group label when one isn't
    specified
  . soon the old engine 1 will go
  . don't worry about script size, there's still a lot of dead wood
  . performance sucks for now.
Time spent processing 24 entries with engine 1 vs 2 & busybox 1.17.1 vs 1.7.2

user:
+ set json "exitmenu":0 (goes with "action") to save KUAL from suicide!
  If your extension prints to the screen it isn't a nice savior.
+ user-configurable page size:
  set KUAL_page_size="<integer>" in file /mnt/us/extensions/**/KUAL.cfg
internal:
+ WIP "suicide" json value
+ added usleep to screen_msg
# stripped one_level(), touch_runner()
+ send KUAL.cfg to Kindlet

--- KT/PW/K3/DX monolithic versions below and above
20130226,a,stepk
# Changed the test applet from 411.sh to printing exit message "Add extensions."
  Test applet (un)install error messages redirected to tier 1 button.
+ Added 'screen reporting area' function for other scripts to call.
  For developers, see README-dev.txt for more info
  (required changing Kindlet java code).

20130225,a,stepk
# changed/renamed command-line options as follows:
  . removed long options: --format --sort --colors --execmenu --log;
    use the short form equivalents: -f -s -c -e -l
  . removed short option -S
    -S becomes -s=123 and -s becomes -s=abc (default)
  . -f=default becomes -f=onelevel (-f=twolevel is the default)
+ added lexicographic sort option to sort by action name in addition to
  sorting by group name; applies to -f=twolevel only. Summary of sort options
  . abc  lexicographic by group, names within each group do not move
  . ABC  lexicographic by group and by action name, same name groups coalesce
  . 123  by priority, group priority first then action priority within group
         (and lexicographic by group name within each priority tier)
+ added KUAL menu to apply all three sort options
+ added visual aid debugging option -p=FMT to output by columns, etc.
# internal changes:
  . tier placement
  . improved error handling and visualization
  . now emit each record as multiple lines
    (required changing the Kindlet's java code - read logic)
- fixed an issue with identical labels in the Kindlet's java code
- minor tweaks and fixes
+ more developer's documentation

20130221,a,stepk
+ read script options from KUAL.cfg, type aloop.sh -h for rules
  (upon config errors the script carries on with default options)
+ option -S or --nsort sorts menu by priority (json)
+ (tada!) enter the ***KUAL menu***
  with three new spanking functions:
  . Change sort order: lexicographic (abc), by priority (123)
  . 'Replace/Restore Store Button' (*)
    K5/PW only, tested on 5.3.2 should work on 5.1.2 also
  . Quit KUAL menu
+ expand entity &nbsp; (only) to hard space in json values
+ $EXTENSIONDIR can be a colon-separated list of directories
- fix: didn't launch action when action path included spaces
(*) KUAL menu entries appear at the end of the button list
    regardless of sort order.

20130208,a,stepk
- fix: prevent null label (Audio recorder and player for KT)
- fix: preserve '$' in labels
- fix: failed when config.xml path included spaces
! change: accept all characters in menu labels
  . ':' '|' aren't stripped anymore
  . white space runs are still squeezed to one space

20130201,a,stepk (silent update)
! test applet: changed PRODUCTNAME to "Kindle Unified Launcher"

20130130,a,stepk
! monolithic KT/PW/K3/DX compatible script (busybox level 1.7.2)
! faster on all platforms
+ allow double quotes in json values, i.e., "params":"-a \"foo bar\""
